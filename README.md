# hiring-process-analytics
Here in this project, i analyzed the company's hiring process data and draw meaningful insights from it. The hiring process is a crucial function of any company, and understanding trends such as the number of rejections, interviews, job types, and vacancies can provide valuable insights for the hiring department.

Here's the overview of what were the objectives for this project. Handling Missing Data: I checked if there are any missing values in the dataset. If there are, decided on the best strategy to handle them. Clubbing Columns: If there are columns with multiple categories that can be combined, did so to simplify my analysis. Outlier Detection: Checked for outliers in the dataset that may skew the analysis. Removing Outliers: Decided on the best strategy to handle outliers. This could be removing them, replacing them, or leaving them as is, depending on the situation. Data Summary: After cleaning and preparing the data, i summarized findings. This involved calculating averages, medians, or other statistical measures. It could also involve creating visualizations to better understand the data.

the goal of this project is to showcase my knowledge of statistics and Excel to draw meaningful conclusions about the company's hiring process. My insights could potentially help the company improve its hiring process and make better hiring decisions in the future.
